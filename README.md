### Summary

This project allows you to sort through given airline, airport and flight route data with pagination. 


### Todo

- Add figure showing start / end flight location of selected data
- "Show All Routes" button should reset selected dropdown option (currently correctly resets displayed flight data)
- Selecting an airline filter option should disable airport filter options that do not have any associated flights
